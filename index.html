        //Arrays are a way of organizing and storing data, it is a foundational concept of programming
        //In real life, we make lists to organize things
        //1. Keep a journal, 2. Take a falconry class, 3. Learn Kubernetes

        //In JavaScript, it would look something like this


    

        //Arrays are JavaScript's way of making lists. 
        //Arrays can store any data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
        //Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position
        //Arrays start with 0

        //We can create an array by using an array literal
        //An array literal creates the array by wrapping the items in square brackets []

        //Arrays can store any data type, and can hold different types, but they are easier to work with when it is one type of info

        //Every item in an array is an element in that array

        //Each element is separated by a comma

        // const hobbies = ['schroeder is a lil guy', 'aidan is a lil guy', 'tony is a lil guy'];
        //to access an element in this array, we type in hobbies[(number 0-2)]
        // let listItem = hobbies[0]
        // console.log(`listItem 0 is ${listItem[0]}`);
        // console.log(`listItem 3 is ${hobbies[2]}`);
        // console.log(`listItem 4 is ${hobbies[3]}`);

        //once you have access to an element in an array you can change its values
        //in order to change the value of an array, we need to change the value of that 
        //index in our array 





        // let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
        // seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
        // console.log(seasons);



        // let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'take a falconry class', 'Learn Kubernetes']; 
        // for (let i = 0; i < newYearsResolutions.length; i++) {
        //     newYearsResolutions[i] = prompt(`What is your ${i+1}stndrd New Years Resolution?`)
        // }
        // console.log(newYearsResolutions);

        //We can declare variables with both the let and const keywords, we prefer to use let
        //Variables with let can be reassigned
        //Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be redefined
        //a const array may be beneficial because you cannot change it away from being an array, but you can change the content inside the array
        let condiments = ['Ketchup', 'Mustard', 'Relish'];
        // condiments = 'Mayo';
        console.log(condiments);
        const utensils = ['fork', 'spoon', 'knife'];
        utensils[utensils.length-1] = 'Spork';
        console.log(utensils);

        // utensils = 'spork';
        // console.log(utensils);
        //an arrays built in property is length and it returns the number of items in the array
        //We can access the length property on strings, not just arrays.
        console.log(`condiments length is,`, condiments.length);

        //in order to push an item to the end of an array, use the .push() method
        //console.log(`condiments length is,`, condiments.length);
        condiments.push('syrup');
        console.log(`condiments is,`, condiments);

        const chores = [];
        chores.push('dishes', 'trash');
        console.log(chores);

        //Another array method, .pop, removes the last item of an array
        const remove= chores.pop();
        console.log(remove);
